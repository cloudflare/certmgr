stealchain

This is a utility to extract the verified X.509 chain from a TLS
connection. It takes a list of sites on the command line; for each
site that it can connect to, it will dump the certificates that the
peer actually sent (and not the verified chain that is built from
this).

It was written to assist in debugging issues with certificate chains.

There are a few knobs:

-ca allows the trusted CA roots to be specified via a PEM bundle of
root certificates.

-sni specifies the server name for SNI. This applies to all hosts in
the run; if this is run as

	$ stealchain -sni foo.com foo.com bar.com

it will attempt to use "foo.com" as the server name for both hosts.

-noverify skips certificate verification. This might be useful for seeing
what certificates a server is actually sending.


Examples:

 	$ stealchain kyleisom.net
	[+] wrote kyleisom.net.pem.
	$ readchain kyleisom.net.pem 
	[+] kyleisom.net.pem:
        	*.kyleisom.net
	        COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA

	$ stealchain google.com microsoft.com apple.com amazon.com
	[+] wrote google.com.pem.
	[+] wrote microsoft.com.pem.
	[+] wrote apple.com.pem.
	[+] wrote amazon.com.pem.
