utc: convert times to UTC

Usage:	utc [-f format] [-o format] [-q] [-t] [-u] [-z zone] [time(s)...]
	utc -h | utc help


utc converts times to UTC. If no arguments are provided, prints the
current time in UTC. If the only argument provided is "-", utc reads
newline-separated timestamps from standard input. If the argument is
"help", it will print an extended help message with examples.  If both
the input and output timezones are the same (e.g., the local time zone
is UTC), a warning message will be printed on standard error. This can
be suppressed with the -q option.

Flags:

	-f format	Go timestamp format for input times. See the Go docs
			(e.g. https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants)
			for an explanation of this format.

			Default value: 2006-01-02 15:04

	-h		Print this help message.

	-o format       Go timestamp format for outputting times.
			It uses the same format as the '-f' argument.

			Default value: 2006-01-02 15:04 MST

	-q		Suppress the timezone check warning message.

	-t              Input times are Unix timestamps. Use with
			-u to convert the timestamp to the timezone
			specified by the -z option (which defaults
			to Local).

	-u              Timestamps are in UTC format and should be
			converted to the timezone specified by the
			-z argument (which defaults to 'Local'). Note
			that this isn't particularly useful with
			no arguments.

	-z zone		Text form of the time zone; this can be in short
			time zone abbreviation (e.g. MST) or a
			location (e.g. America/Los_Angeles). This
			has no effect when printing the current
			time.

			Default value: Local

Examples (note that the examples are done in the America/Los_Angeles /
PST8PDT time zone):

	+ Getting the current time in UTC:
	  $ utc
	  2016-06-14 14:30 PDT = 2016-06-14 21:30 UTC
	+ Converting a local timestamp to UTC:
	  $ utc '2016-06-14 21:30'
	  2016-06-14 21:30 PDT = 2016-06-15 04:30 UTC
	+ Converting a local EST timestamp to UTC (on a machine set to
  	  PST8PDT):
	  $ utc -z EST '2016-06-14 21:30'  
	  2016-06-14 21:30 EST = 2016-06-15 02:30 UTC
	+ Converting timestamps in the form '14-06-2016 3:04PM':
	  $ utc -f '02-01-2006 3:04PM' '14-06-2016 9:30PM'
	  2016-06-14 21:30 PDT = 2016-06-15 04:30 UTC
	+ Converting timestamps from standard input:
	  $ printf "2016-06-14 14:42\n2016-06-13 11:01" | utc -
	  2016-06-14 14:42 PDT = 2016-06-14 21:42 UTC
	  2016-06-13 11:01 PDT = 2016-06-13 18:01 UTC
	+ Converting a UTC timestamp to the local time zone:
	  $ utc -u '2016-06-14 21:30'
	  2016-06-14 21:30 UTC = 2016-06-14 14:30 PDT
	+ Converting a UTC timestamp to EST (on a machine set to
	  PST8PDT):
	  $ utc -u -z EST '2016-06-14 21:30'
	  2016-06-14 21:30 UTC = 2016-06-14 16:30 EST
	+ Using a different output format:
	  $ utc -o '2006-01-02T15:03:04-0700' '2016-06-14 21:30' 
	  2016-06-14T21:09:30-0700 = 2016-06-15T04:04:30+0000
	+ Converting a Unix timestamp to a UTC time:
	  $ utc -t 1466052938
	  2016-06-15 21:55 PDT = 2016-06-16 04:55 UTC
	+ Converting a Unix timestamp to local time:
	  $ utc -t -u 1466052938
	  2016-06-16 04:55 UTC = 2016-06-15 21:55 PDT
	+ Converting a Unix timestamp to EST:
	  $ utc -t -u -z EST 1466052938
	  2016-06-16 04:55 UTC = 2016-06-15 23:55 EST
	+ Example of the warning message when running utc on a machine
	  where the local time zone is UTC:
	  $ utc
	   
	  ==================================================================
	  Note: both input and output timezone offsets are the same --- this
	  program may not do what you expect it to.
	   
	  (Converting from UTC (offset +0000) to UTC (offset +0000).)
	  ==================================================================
	  2016-06-14 23:44 = 2016-06-14 23:44
	+ Example of the warning message when running utc on a machine
	  where the local time zone is GMT:
	  $ utc
	   
	  ==================================================================
	  Note: both input and output timezone offsets are the same --- this
	  program may not do what you expect it to.
	   
	  (Converting from GMT (offset +0000) to UTC (offset +0000).)
	  ==================================================================
	  2016-06-14 23:46 = 2016-06-14 23:46
