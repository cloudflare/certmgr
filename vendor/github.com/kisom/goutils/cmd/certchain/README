certchain

This is a utility for printing the X.509 certificate chain from a TLS
connection.

Note: while this will accept more than one server, it will print all
of the chains without any indication where one chain ends and the next
begins. This was the intended behaviour for the use case, but it may
not be applicable in other cases.

There are no knobs.

Examples:
	$ certchain www.kyleisom.net
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
	MIIFUTCCBDmgAwIBAgIQaaTVw0yZFGAYvFDKAIo4BzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB
