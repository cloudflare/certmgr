renfnv

This renames a file to the base32-encoded 64-bit FNV-1a hash of the
file's contents. The extension is preserved. This was motivated by
a desire to normalise names for photographs.

Usage: renfnv [-fhlnv] files...

        -f      force overwriting of files when there is a collision.
        -h      print this help message.
        -l      list changed files.
        -n      Perform a dry run: don't actually move files.
        -v      Print all files as they are processed. If both -v and -l
                are specified, it will behave as if only -v was specified.
